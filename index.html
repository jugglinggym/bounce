      </div>

      <p>
      This guide is a detailed resource to learn bounce juggling.
      It will first <a href="introduction.html">introduce</a> you to bounce juggling and how to practice.
      Next, there are tutorials for the basics of bounce juggling, the <a href="lift_bounce.html">Lift Bounce Cascade</a> and the <a href="force_bounce.html">Force Bounce Cascade</a>.
      After you’ve learned these foundational patterns, feel free to pick and choose what to learn next.
      The tricks are sorted into three categories: Beginner Tricks, Intermediate Tricks, and Advanced Tricks.
      Within each category, I tried to put the easiest tricks first, but you may find that some tricks are slightly easier or harder.
      </p>

      <p>
      Each trick will list the prerequisites, number of balls required for the trick, and the date the trick was last modified.
      Prerequisites are skills that you <b>must</b> know before learning the trick. Sometimes, a trick will have optional prerequisites.
      Optional prerequisites are related skills that are helpful to learning the trick but not strictly necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
      For each trick tutorial, I assume that you’re right-handed, simply because it’s more clear to write that way.
      Many trick tutorials are accompanied by detailed illustrations that depict a right-handed person juggling.
      If you want to see a left-handed person juggling, press the "Flip" button on the top of the screen and all of the images will flip.
      Throughout the guide, RH stands for right hand, and LH stands for left hand.

      <p>
      This guide is for anyone who wants to learn how to bounce juggle.
      You do not need to know anything about juggling to use this guide.
      All of the tricks and terminology will be explained thoroughly.
      </p>

      <p>
      You don’t need to know how to toss juggle in order to bounce juggle.
      The most basic 3 ball bounce pattern is a bit slower than the regular 3 ball toss pattern, so it’s actually easier.
      Many jugglers find bounce juggling to be easier than toss juggling.
      Of course, if you already know how to juggle, many of the skills that you learned from toss juggling will transfer to bounce juggling.
      When relevant, I will make comparisons between bounce juggling and toss juggling.

      This guide is completely free. I wrote this guide because I love juggling and want to share my favorite hobby with others.
      There are no advertisements, and I’m not collecting any of your personal information.

      My name is Logan, I’ve been juggling for the past four years. About two years into regular toss juggling,
      I began bounce juggling. I enjoyed bounce juggling, but it was really hard to find resources to learn it.
      Friends taught me some tricks, and I adapted tricks that I knew from toss juggling into bounce juggling by myself.
      I’ve created this guide to be a detailed resource so that anyone can learn bounce juggling.
